# Java Spring Boot Examples
This repository contains various examples (or templates) of Java Spring Boot applications I've made to simplify the creation of my future projects. You can use these examples as a starting point for your own applications.

## Usage
You can find list of available examples in branches. Each branch contains a different example of a Spring Boot application. To use an example, simply clone the repository and switch to the desired branch.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
git checkout <branch-name>
```

## Note
These examples are not production-ready and probably should not be used as educational material due to my limited experience. They are intended to be a quick reference for common tasks and configurations in Spring Boot applications.
